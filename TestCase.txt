The program is interactive. 
I have run the following test cases

1> create 1 list, add node, remove node, display the list, remove list, exit the program.
   When I re-run the program the last time present list gets loaded from the file and I can perform the same operations again on its nodes.

2> created 100 lists and performed all the operations(add node, remove node, remove list, display list) on different different lists.  
   After exiting from the program and re-runing the program all the lists which are present at the time of last exit get reloaded and I 
   am able to perform the operations.

3> I tried edge cases as well as normal case.
   
   a) Deleting a node which are not present.
   b) Deleting a list which are not present.
   c) Adding the node in the list which doesn't exist.
   d) Displaying a list which doesn't exist.
   e) Deleting the head of link list
   f) Deleting tail of the link list
   g) Deleting any any other non-extreme node of link list
   h) Tested with all sort of positive and negative value for link list
   i) Deleting the last link list from the file
   j) Deleting the top link list from the file
   k) Creating an empty list and writing to the file
   l) lists with duplicated value 
   m) lists with sorted input values
   n) lists with random input values
   o) lists with non-increasing sorted input values
   p) lists with around 100 nodes.
   q) lists with duplicate values and all operations on them

4) I also tested with noise input like some "character entry" for list id or node values.
